Our alternative hypothesis is that our data is distrbuted in another way other than normally.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5 : Interpret the p-values. Are these variables normally distributed?\n\nAnswer : I ran the Shaprio-Wilk test on four out of the six variables in this dataset which were Ozone, Temp, Solar.R, and Wind. As we know, having a p-value &lt;0.05 means that it is signifcant enough to reject the null hypothesis and if it is above 0.05 then we fail to reject the hypothesis.\nFor the Ozone residual it had the p-value of 2.846e-08 and is normally distributed.\nFor the Temperature residual it had a p-value of 0.09569 and is not normally distributed.\nFor the Solar.R residual it had a p-value of 2.957e-05 and is normally distributed.\nFor the Wind residual it had a p-value of 0.1099 and is not normally distributed."
