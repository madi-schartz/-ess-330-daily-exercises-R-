###Question 1 : 
```{r}
?"airquality"
```

###Question 2 :
```{r}
airquality_clean <- na.omit(airquality)

```

###Question 3 & 4 : 
I decided to use a linear model to see if solar has any correlation with ozone levels. 
```{r}
library(broom)

lm_model <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality_clean)

a <- augment(lm_model)


```
###Question 5 : 
The R squared is found to be a value of 0.12 which means that this model doesn't explain much of ozone variation despite the solar r being significant it doesn't have strong explanatory power. 

###Question 6 :
```{r}
summary(lm_model)
```

###Question 7 :
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(a, aes(x = Ozone, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_point() +  # scatter plot of actual vs predicted Ozone
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red") +  # 1:1 line
  labs(
    title = "Actual vs Predicted Ozone",
    subtitle = paste("Correlation: ", round(cor(a$Ozone, a$.fitted), 2)),
    x = "Actual Ozone",
    y = "Predicted Ozone"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
